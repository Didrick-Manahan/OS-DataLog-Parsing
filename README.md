# OS-DataLog-Parsing
Includes two different data-log clustering algorithms; simple log file clustering tool (SLCT) and a state-of-the-art fixed depth (Drain). Pre-processing through filtering and deduplication is also performed. Our implementations in Python are tested with Windows and Linux Operating System (OS) logs

# Results
Our implementations in Python are evaluated on Windows and Linux Operating System (OS) logs using adjusted rand index (ARI), adjusted mutual information score (AMIS), and Fowlkes Mallows index (FMI). Results can be viewed under "results.txt".
